## Hi!

Itâ€™s me, Mahboobe (Persian: Ù…Ø­Ø¨ÙˆØ¨Ù‡). Iâ€™m a computer engineer by training and a software engineer by day.

When I am not busy with software development,  I read textbooks in computer science and sometimes economics. 

Compared to all other communication methods, I respond to emails much more faster.
